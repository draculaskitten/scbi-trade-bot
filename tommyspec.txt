Hi Tommy,

So - that discord bot I was talking about last month.. you still up for a possible looking at doing this for me?  Here are the broadbrushstroke features and functionality. What would you charge me to build this? $$

Discord Trade Bot:

Functionality: The Bot Listens to a text channel, adds reactions in that channel, and updates a table in a second channel.
2 channels: Trade and Trade_Summary
Users input into the Trade channel and results are displayed in a read-only table in Trade_Summary. 
The bot puts a checkmark reaction under commands on the trade channel that it has seen and updated to the table on trade_summary.

Commands:
need $n text string
have $n text string
reset needs
reset haves

need item: adds the {user} of the command to the table on trade_summary with the number variable and text string (if the user is already in the table, it appends that users list with the new addition.)
have item: adds the {user} of the command to the table on Trade_summary with the number variable and text stringe
note: for both these, using a "have 0 text string" command removes that item from the table. if it is the last item that user has in the table, it also removes the user's name from the table.

reset needs: removes all need items from the table for that {user} and removes that {user} from the table.
reset haves: removes all have items from the table for that {user} and removes that {user} from the table.

Advanced functionality:
1. Auto replace "text string" with game icons where possible (I have a library of these) or discord icons. (You can only have 50 custom icons, so we use some of the discord standard ones in place of game ones.)
2. Allow users to put a :reaction: on another user's have items command if they buy those items from the user in game. (Removes the item from the haves list in the table.)

PS: I started playing with Dyno Bot for discord and it has a custom commands section, but I don't know how to write the code that would actually do these features. But using that as the basis for the trade bot might be possible and cut a bunch of time off the project?
